# How It Works

## Daemon

The daemon is the central coordinator. It runs an event-driven state machine that collects an immutable snapshot of the world each tick, makes pure decisions about what should happen, and then executes the resulting effects. This strict separation between decision logic and side effects keeps the core testable.

The daemon handles:
- Coworker lifecycle (spawning, health checks, stuck detection, shutdown)
- Task assignment and dispatch
- GitHub webhook processing (PR events, CI status, reviews)
- PR polling for merge conflicts and stuck conditions
- @mention routing between team members
- Plugin RPC endpoints for the Zellij dashboard (see below)

## Coworkers

Each coworker runs as:

- A headless Claude Code process (`claude -p --output-format stream-json`) managed by the daemon's `SessionManager`
- In an isolated git worktree (no merge conflicts during development)
- With `--add-dir` worktrees for additional repos in multi-repo projects
- Nudges are delivered via stdin JSON, and health is monitored via stdout stream events

Coworkers are named after Manhattan avenues: lexington, park, madison, broadway, amsterdam, columbus, riverside, york, pleasant, vernon.

## Channel Sync

Coworkers stay synchronized via a Claude Code Stop hook. When Claude pauses, the hook reads new channel messages and checks for unclaimed tasks. This means coworkers automatically receive updates at natural pause points.

## Mailbox Messaging

In addition to the shared channel, the daemon can deliver targeted messages to individual coworkers via the Claude Code agent teams mailbox protocol. Messages are written as JSON to `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/inboxes/{agent-name}.json` using atomic file operations with mkdir-based locking for safe concurrent access.

## Worktree Lifecycle

When a coworker is called in, midtown creates a detached git worktree at the current HEAD. The coworker creates a feature branch and works independently. When the coworker shuts down, worktrees with no commits and no uncommitted changes are automatically cleaned up along with their branches. Worktrees with work in progress are preserved.

## GitHub Integration

The daemon receives real-time GitHub events via webhooks (PR creation, reviews, check runs) verified with HMAC-SHA256 signatures. PR polling runs as a backstop for missed webhook deliveries and handles time-based concerns like merge conflict detection and stuck PR identification.

## Webhook Ports

Each project daemon runs its own webhook server for GitHub integration. Port 47022 is reserved for the shared multi-project webserver. Per-project daemons auto-assign ports starting at 47023, persisting the assignment in the project's `config.toml` for stability across restarts.

## Chat TUI

The `midtown chat` command opens a split-panel interface with:

**Layout**:
- **Board panel** (left 40%): Channel swimlanes showing in-progress (●) and pending (○) tasks per channel
- **Chat panel** (right 60%): Real-time message display with mermaid diagram rendering
- **Input bar** (bottom): Text input for posting messages (Tab to focus, Enter to send)

**Features**:
- Real-time channel message display
- Mermaid diagram detection and rendering (via `selkie-rs` with content-hash caching)
- Inline ASCII art for flowchart diagrams (press number keys to open SVG in browser)
- **Type-anywhere UX**: Character keys auto-focus the input bar (like Slack/Discord)
- Tab-based focus navigation (Board → Chat → InputBar)
- Arrow keys, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End for scrolling
- Mouse support for scrolling and navigation
- Clickable hyperlinks via OSC 8 escape sequences
- Real-time token usage and cost tracking

## Web UI

The web interface is a Svelte 5 + Vite SPA served on port 47022:

- Installable as a PWA for mobile use
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Kanban board for task visualization
- Multi-channel support with split-panel layout (channel list sidebar + message pane)
- Channel list with task counts (in progress, pending) and CI status badges
- Channel header displays channel-specific stats (PR count, in-progress tasks, pending tasks) that update when switching channels
- Create new channels directly from the sidebar (+ button) with inline validation
- Clickable channel (`#name`), task (`!N`), and PR (`#N`) references in messages
- Insight cross-post highlighting with source channel attribution
- Mermaid diagram rendering in chat messages
- Image and document paste support (clipboard → inline preview → upload to lead)
- Coworker status monitoring
- Auth profile switching
- Push notifications (W3C Push API with VAPID)
- Responsive layout with three breakpoints:
  - **Mobile (≤768px)**: Tab navigation, hamburger menu with slide-out sidebar, modal popups for task/PR details
  - **Tablet (769–1024px)**: Permanent sidebar replaces tab navigation, two-column grid layout
  - **Desktop (≥1025px)**: Three-column Slack-inspired layout with sidebar, main channel, and toggleable detail panel for tasks, PRs, and coworker info
- Clickable `@coworker` mentions in messages open coworker detail panel on desktop

## Plugin RPC (Zellij Integration)

The daemon exposes RPC endpoints for the Zellij WASM plugin via `src/daemon/rpc_plugin.rs`. Shared types live in the `midtown-types` crate so both the daemon and the plugin can serialize/deserialize the same structures.

**Endpoints:**
- `plugin.dashboard` — Returns a complete `DashboardState` snapshot (tasks, coworkers, channel messages, queued lead nudges). The plugin polls this ~1/s. Lead nudges are drained on read.
- `plugin.attach` — Pauses a headless coworker and returns its session ID so the plugin can launch `claude --resume <id>` in a terminal pane.
- `plugin.detach` — Resumes headless execution after the user detaches from an interactive session.
- `plugin.coworker-stream` — Returns recent streaming events from a headless coworker's JSON stream for a read-only activity view.

**DaemonState fields for plugin support:**
- `lead_nudge_queue: Mutex<Vec<String>>` — Queued lead nudges. `Effect::NudgeLead` appends here (capped at 50 entries); `plugin.dashboard` drains the queue on each poll.
- `stream_event_buffer: RwLock<HashMap<String, Vec<BufferedStreamEvent>>>` — Ring buffer (max 100 events per coworker) of recent stream events for the coworker-stream endpoint.
- `attached_coworkers: Mutex<HashSet<String>>` — Tracks which coworkers are currently attached via the plugin (exempted from health checks and dispatch).

## Reminders

The Lead can set reminders that trigger on specific conditions:

```bash
# Remind me when all tasks are done and PRs merged
midtown lead remind all-work-merged "Time to deploy!"

# List active reminders
midtown lead remind list

# Cancel a reminder
midtown lead remind cancel <id>
```

Reminders are stored in `~/.midtown/projects/<repo>/reminders.json` and evaluated by the daemon each tick.
