# Configuration

Midtown uses two levels of config files:

1. **Global config** at `~/.midtown/config.toml` — applies to all projects
2. **Project config** at `~/.midtown/projects/<project>/config.toml` — overrides per project

Project settings take precedence over global defaults. All fields are optional.

## Global `config.toml`

```toml
# ~/.midtown/config.toml

[default]
bin_command = "midtown"         # CLI command to invoke midtown
chat_layout = "auto"            # "auto", "split", or "window"
chat_min_width = 160            # Min terminal width for split layout (auto mode)
max_coworkers = 10              # Maximum concurrent coworkers

[daemon]
webhook_port = 47022                  # Web UI & webhook port (0 to disable)
webhook_secret = "your-secret"        # GitHub webhook signature secret
webhook_restart_interval_secs = 300   # Webhook forwarder restart interval
pr_poll_interval_secs = 30            # PR polling interval
chat_monitor_enabled = true           # Enable @mention routing
```

## Project `config.toml`

Project configs support all global settings plus project metadata:

```toml
# ~/.midtown/projects/myapp/config.toml

[project]
name = "myapp"
repos = ["/path/to/backend", "/path/to/frontend"]
primary_repo = "/path/to/backend"

[default]
bin_command = "cargo run --release --"
max_coworkers = 4

[daemon]
webhook_port = 47023              # Auto-assigned if not set

[channels]
seed = ["tui", "web-interface", "daemon", "docs"]  # Pre-populated channels
```

The `[project]` section defines:

- `name` - Project name used for tmux sessions, paths, etc.
- `repos` - List of repository paths belonging to the project
- `primary_repo` - The main repo used for the daemon socket and channel

For single-repo projects, only `name` is needed; `repos` and `primary_repo` are inferred from the working directory. This config is auto-created on first `midtown start`.

The `[channels]` section defines:

- `seed` - Pre-populated topic channels created at daemon startup

Seed channels help guide the clusterer's task organization by establishing architectural channels upfront. When tasks are created, the clusterer can route them to existing seed channels rather than always creating new ones. Seed channels are created automatically when the daemon starts and don't need manual creation.

**Example:** For a project with distinct TUI, web, and daemon subsystems, seed channels help organize work by architecture:

```toml
[channels]
seed = ["tui", "web-interface", "daemon-core", "github-integration", "testing", "docs"]
```

The clusterer will prefer routing tasks to these established channels when appropriate, reducing channel proliferation and keeping related work grouped consistently.

## Environment Variable Overrides

Daemon settings can be overridden with environment variables:

| Variable | Overrides |
|----------|-----------|
| `MIDTOWN_WEBHOOK_PORT` | `webhook_port` |
| `MIDTOWN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `webhook_secret` |
| `MIDTOWN_WEBHOOK_RESTART_INTERVAL` | `webhook_restart_interval_secs` |
| `MIDTOWN_PR_POLL_INTERVAL` | `pr_poll_interval_secs` |
| `MIDTOWN_CHAT_MONITOR` | `chat_monitor_enabled` (set to `0` to disable) |
| `MIDTOWN_MAX_COWORKERS` | `max_coworkers` |

## Custom System Prompts

Customize the system prompts for Lead and Coworkers with markdown files:

- `~/.midtown/LEAD.md` / `~/.midtown/COWORKER.md` - Global custom prompts
- `~/.midtown/projects/<project>/LEAD.md` / `COWORKER.md` - Per-project custom prompts

Content from these files is appended to the built-in system prompts. Project-level files supplement global ones.
